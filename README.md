# AssemblyLanguageProjects
## First Project :
Write a program that writes 5 numbers to memory by using
Register Indirect Addressing. Store your numbers at
memory addresses from 2000h to 2004h. In the end,
your memory must look like this:

<br><br>

## Second Project :
Write an assembly program which is able to write a given set of
characters in an array to another array in reverse order. For
example; if an array A is [‘c’ ‘e’ ‘n’ ‘g’] then array B must be [‘g’ ‘n’ ‘e’
‘c’].

## Third Project :
Write an assembly code that determines if a pre-defined number can be divided by 2, 3, 5 or 10. You can define the number as a variable in the code (e.g. “k db 15”). Your program must follow the steps below:

- You must define a number.
- Check if the number can be divided by 2, 3, 5 or 10.
- If the number can be divided any of the numbers mentioned above, it must print a message that includes the divisor number. (You must define a procedure for printing)
- If the number can be divided none of the numbers mentioned above, the program must exit without printing anything. 

EXAMPLE : If the defined number is 15, then the output must be as:
